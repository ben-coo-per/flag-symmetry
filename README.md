## Ever wonder how many of the world flags are symmetrical?

During a long car ride, a friend and I were joking about how [the whole flag controversy with Justice Samuel Alito's wife](https://apnews.com/article/justice-samuel-alito-upsidedown-flag-trump-jan6-f5809b9fd3be19b2359907f7b16651e5) wouldn't have happened if we had a flag like ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­Switzerland's, since there's no way to hang it upside down.

This got me thinking more broadly about flag symmetry. Plus, I've been wanting an excuse to learn Rust, so voilÃ !
